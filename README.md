**Conclusion**

The report helps to capture few clear trends in employee attrition. Employees show a tendency to switch to other organizations in the early part of their career which gradually reduces as they gain more work experience. Income and stock options are rewarding ways of controlling attrition, but work-life balance does not have a direct impact on attrition or may be, employees are always in search of improving work-life balance. Sales which involve meeting targets and is high stress environment observes higher attrition than R&D which is relatively stress free. Further, a comparative study of three supervised learning algorithms suggests that “Logistic Regression” is the best suited model to predict attrition with high Accuracy and F1-score.
